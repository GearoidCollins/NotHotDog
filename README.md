# Not Hot Dog (See Food)

As we are avid fans of the HBO series Silicon Valley I decided to take some inspiration from one of their episodes to build out a groundbreaking app. In Season 4 Episode 3 they come up with the idea of **"Shazam for food"** and call it "**[SeeFood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=LDQcgkDn0yU)**".

To build this we decided to integrate with **[Google's Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/labels)** to identify image properties and build the whole thing in React Native using the fantastic cross-platform development tool **[Expo](https://expo.io/)**.

:warning:**This was thrown together as boilerplate code for us to play with on a Friday and by no means is production ready.*
